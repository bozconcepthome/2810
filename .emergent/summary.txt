The previous AI engineer successfully initiated an e-commerce platform, Boz Concept Home, from a GitHub repository. The core task involved migrating an existing codebase, setting up the development environment, and then incrementally adding and fixing features based on user requests. The engineer started by exploring the codebase, cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and verifying service health (FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB).

Throughout the trajectory, the engineer addressed various user requests, including making the Boz Plus page public, fixing missing categories in the admin panel by seeding the database, implementing Add to Cart buttons, refining checkout delivery options, shortening toast notifications, and developing robust user account management features like HesabÄ±m and Forgot Password. Key technical challenges involved debugging authentication flow, Pydantic model attribute access in FastAPI, and complex conditional rendering in React for shipping rules and user states. The engineer consistently re-verified changes via preview links and API calls, ensuring the stability of the application with each update.

<product_requirements>
The user initiated the project by providing a GitHub repository () and requested to continue development from where the previous session ended, specifically asking for an app preview. The application is an e-commerce platform named Boz Concept Home, featuring customer and admin panels.

The development trajectory addressed the following:
- Initial setup: Cloning the GitHub repo, installing dependencies, and ensuring services are running.
- Database seeding: Populating products, categories, and admin users.
- Public Boz Plus page: Making the  page accessible without login, including navigation links.
- Admin panel category synchronization: Ensuring product categories are visible and manageable in the admin interface.
- Enhanced shopping experience: Adding Add to Cart buttons to product listings (initially homepage, then products page), and fixing cart functionality.
- Checkout process improvements: Changing the mahalle (neighborhood) selection from a dropdown to a manual text input.
- UI/UX refinements: Shortening toast notification durations and ensuring the navbar correctly displays HesabÄ±m (My Account) or GiriÅŸ (Login) based on user authentication status.
- Account management: Implementing HesabÄ±m features (email/password change) and Åžifremi Unuttum (Forgot Password) functionality.
- Dynamic shipping rules: Implementing a payment method (credit card only), minimum order value (500 TL), tiered shipping costs (100 TL for <500 TL, free for >=500 TL), and free shipping for Boz Plus members, along with incentive messages and a Continue Shopping button.
- Comprehensive link provision: Providing all customer-facing and admin panel URLs at the end of the session.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no explicitly pending tasks from the user's trajectory. All requests made were implemented and verified by the previous AI engineer.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer completed the implementation of refined shipping rules and Boz Plus incentive messages across both the Checkout and Cart pages. This involved updating the total calculation to correctly apply 100 TL shipping for non-Boz Plus members with orders under 500 TL, and free shipping for orders 500 TL and above, or always free for Boz Plus members.

The engineer also added a ðŸ’° X â‚º daha alÄ±ÅŸveriÅŸ yapÄ±n, kargo bedava olsun! message to encourage customers to increase their cart value, dynamically updating 'X' based on the current cart total. A AlÄ±ÅŸveriÅŸe Devam Et button was integrated into the order summary sections of both  and  pages to facilitate continued shopping. Finally, the Boz Plus incentive message was expanded to highlight both free shipping and product price discounts. The last action was to provide a comprehensive list of all customer-facing and admin panel links, confirming the application's full functionality.
